In this mock assignment, you will be doing a code review for a junior engineer. This code will deploy to production immediately after merge.

1. Make sure to check for functionality
2. quality 
3. style
4. test coverage
5. typos, etc. 


We want to get a sense of your ability to read code, solve problems, and communicate to team members. We expect the review to be done in the current PR and not as an attachment, new folder, email, etc. Good luck!
